Description: An R package for creating interactive visualisations of Rt estimates using D3.js 
  (Gibbs et al. (2020) <doi:10.5281/zenodo.4011842>). Developed with Rt estimates 
  generated by the EpiNow2 package, RtD3 aims to make simple, beautiful 
  visualisations that help researchers easily share their results with others.
